publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,

  # example:

        - asset: fonts/Quicksand-Light.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Quicksand-Medium.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Quicksand-Regular.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/Quicksand-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700

    # - family: Poppins
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
